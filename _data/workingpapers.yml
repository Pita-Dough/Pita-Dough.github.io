    abstract: "I analyze rematching in two-sided matching markets. An initial match endows market participant with rights: every participant has the right to remain with her initial partner. I propose a new equilibrium solution requiring that an agent can only object to a match if her initial partner agrees to the objection. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm that constructs such a match. I show my algorithm is immune to a variety of manipulations, and it has applications to numerous markets including the resident-to-hospital match, college admissions, school choice, and labor markets."

    abstract: "I study a behavioral model of early matching within the context of the National Resident Matching Program. In my model, two hospitals choose to give early offers to doctors prior to a stable match. Some doctors have a behavioral preference to early match while others do not. I show that the less-desirable program benefits from the option to make early offers. My results provide a theoretical foundation for behavior widely documented within the medical ethics and graduate medical education literature and confirm beliefs commonly held by residency program directors."
